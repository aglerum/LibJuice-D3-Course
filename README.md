### Week 4 Assignment Preview -- WORK IN PROGRESS!
_Note:_ http://htmlpreview.github.io/? did not work with this assignment, so I loaded the project on my FSU web server. This project is not yet complete. The tool tips and zoom functions are solely browser-based and not intentionally coded. Goals for this project are filters to display the data by college, department, or year.
